Change Log

vD3.6.7 SCL 20150410
- merge NSayer PR: Latest OpenEVSE II 1.0 hardware changes #30
1. Gut ReadACPins(). It s unused.
2. GROUND_TEST_PIN is gone in the 1.0 hardware.
3. RELAY_TEST_PIN is high when charging or it s a ground fail. It s low
when not charging or it s a stuck relay.

vD3.6.6 SCL 20150406
- added SAMPLE_ACPINS logic for setup with MID400 using inline diodes
- added FT_ENDURANCE and FT_READ_AC_PINS
- replace booleans w/ uint8_t
- in GfiSelfTest() delay(50) when reading GFI_PIN
- add GFI self test before closing relay per UL (UL_GFI_SELFTEST)
- change GFI_TEST_CYCLES 50->60 GFI_PULSE_DURATION_US 8000->8333

vD3.6.5 SCL 20150406
- added HardFault()
- GFI_RETRY_COUNT 255 -> 6 and GFI_TIMEOUT 1min -> 5min
- set SERVICE REQUIRED message after GFI retries exhausted
- added nosave parm to SetCurrentCapacity()

vD3.6.4 SCL 20150406
- fix compile error in rapi_proc.cpp due to prog_char fix
- CraigK Patch 6: temp monitoring and kWh recording
- CraigK OpenEvse II ammeter calibration (Craigk46 patch 8)
- SCL move g_ampacity to g_TempMonitor.m_ampacity

vD3.6.3 SCL 20150403
- fix compile errors in Arduino 1.5.8+ due to deprecation of prog_char

vD3.6.2 SCL 20150326
- add delay(200) to beginning of setup() to fix random LCD black out at boot
	Thanks to CraigK!
- code cleanup on KWH_RECORDING .. change eeprom_read_byte() to eeprom_read_dword()

vD3.6.1 SCL 20150311
- merge CraigK patch-4 temp monitoring fixes

vD3.6.0 SCL 20150301
- add CraigK TEMPERATURE_MONITORING

vD3.5.2 SCL 20150226
- minor fixes for millis() overflow handling
- change code to allow RED_LED_PIN and GREEN_LED_PIN to be commented out w/o causing compile errors

SCL 20150220
- merge NSayer pull request OpenEVSE II hardware now only performs ground test during charging

vD3.5.1 SCL 20150218
- added FT_GFI_LOCKOUT/FT_GFI_RETRY for functional testing
- per UL Fred Reyes, stuck relay always results in hard fault (lockout)
- GFI_RETRY_COUNT to 255 (infinite) instead of 15

vD3.5.0 SCL 20150216
- added UL_COMPLIANT: UL wants EVSE to hard fault (cease operation until manual intervention)
  1) if POST fails
  2) if fault happens immediately after charge starts
- consolidated some redundant fault strings
- if AutoSvcLevel couldn't be detected due to car being plugged in during POST,
  and L1 was set because of this, upon first charge session, we will detect the
  actual svc level, and switch to L2 if detected

vD3.4.3 SCL 20150213
- don't do GFI self test in doPost() if other fault already found
- when in menus, lock out all other functions until exit 
- do stuck relay chk in POST even if EV is plugged in and AutoSvcLevel()
- for safety, set to L1 if AutoSvcLevel and car is plugged in during POST,
  because we can't auto detect level.

vD3.4.2 SCL 20150210
- added SLEEP_STATUS_PIN
	
vD3.4.1 SCL 20150205
- forgot to set svcState to SR when stuck relay test fails in doPost() and
	not AutoSvcLevel()
	
vD3.4.0 SCL 20150123
- added writing of safety check trip counters to EEPROM
- added RAPI $GF
- setting GFI_RETRY_COUNT to 255 will make it retry indefinitely
- changed GFI_RETRY_COUNT from 3 to 15, GFI_TIMEOUT from 15min to 1min
  -> now, tests will retry 15 times at one minute intervals
     instead of 3 retries at 15 min intervals
