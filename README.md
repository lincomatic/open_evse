
Firmware for OpenEVSE controller used in OpenEnergyMonitor EmonEVSE units solde in (UK/EU) via the OpenEnergyMonitor store. In collaboration with OpenEVSE.

Based on OpenEVSE: Open Source Hardware J1772 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment

Custom changes by OpenEnergyMonitor:

- Disable `AUTOSVCLEVEL` (autodetection is designed for split-phase)
- Charging level default to `L2`
- Set `MAX_CURRENT_CAPACITY_L2 32` (limit for single-phase charging in UK/EU)
- Add '.EU' to version number

NOTES:
- Working versions of the required libraries are included in the libraries/ folder
- PlatformIO / Arduino 1.6.x+ is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED for compiling OpenEVSE. Older versions of Arduino will build sketches which are too big to fit into OpenEVSE, unless features are disabled.
