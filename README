This is the stable branch


Firmware for Open EVSE: Open Source Hardware J1772 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment
See http://code.google.com/p/open-evse/ for project details.

Compilation help: http://code.google.com/p/open-evse/wiki/LoadingFirmware

NOTES:
- Working versions of the required libraries are included in the libraries/ folder
- It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use Arduino 0022 to compile OpenEVSE. Arduino 1.x and later versions not only build larger sketches, but also have been found to have compiler bugs.
