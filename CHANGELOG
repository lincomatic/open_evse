- fix compile error caused by include for LiquidCrystal_I2C.h
	
vD3.10.0 SCL 20151012
- fix bug introduced by diode check state oscillation fix in D3.9.9 - if 
  transition to sleep while charging, on sleep exit would go into VENT REQ error
  -> if pilot voltage in State C range, but PWM off, go to State B
     this is an added safety feature, because State C should never be allowed
     when PWM is off
- fix bug: if enter sleep mode due to time/charge limit met, sleep should
  automatically be cancelled when car disconnected but it was staying in sleep
	
vD3.9.10 CWK 20150920
- GFI Self Test Duty Cylce restored to 50%

vD3.9.9 CWK/SCL 20150914

vD3.9.5 SCL 20150722

	-> automatically cancel sleep mode when car disconnected *only if* the
	   sleep was induced by time/charge limit
	2. decouple temperature monitoring from J1772EVSEController::Update()
	-> so that temperature is still monitored when EVSE disabled/sleeping
	3. ProcessInputs() removed from J1772EVSEController
	4. added TEMPERATURE_MONITORING_NY (not yet) code .. currently disabled
	-> $GO/$SO RAPI

  1) if POST fails
  2) if fault happens immediately after charge starts
- consolidated some redundant fault strings

  and L1 was set because of this, upon first charge session, we will detect the
  actual svc level, and switch to L2 if detected

- don't do GFI self test in doPost() if other fault already found
- when in menus, lock out all other functions until exit 
- do stuck relay chk in POST even if EV is plugged in and AutoSvcLevel()

- added writing of safety check trip counters to EEPROM
- added RAPI $GF
- setting GFI_RETRY_COUNT to 255 will make it retry indefinitely
- changed GFI_RETRY_COUNT from 3 to 15, GFI_TIMEOUT from 15min to 1min
